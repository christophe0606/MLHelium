# Common

Very simple framework used by the examples (to load weights).

The goal of those functions is to be able to read the data generated by the Python functions from `export.py`

Those function gives access to `f32` and `f16` aligned buffer contained inside a `uint8` buffer.

Note that the shapes and strides of those tensors are not saved in the data structure.

The data structure only contain the minimum information required on the Python side to be able to re-read the samples (but not the tensors - the reading will consider the tensor as flattened).

The C code using the exported data structure should have knowledge of the tensor shapes.
